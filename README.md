Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a computer vision task aimed at identifying and categorizing emotional expressions depicted on a human face. 
The goal is to automate the process of determining emotions in real-time, by analyzing the various features of a face such as eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and other features, and mapping them to a set of emotions such as anger, fear, surprise, sadness and happiness.
